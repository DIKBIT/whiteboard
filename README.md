# whiteboard
A simple multi-user canvas wired with sockets.


This is an example of a canvas accessible (and editable) by multiple users.

This time I wanted to learn something about sockets, namely Socket.Io framework, hence I did the backend using it together with Express.

Clone this repo using git clone.
run npn install
when npm finishes, run node app.js
Open your browser, go to http://localhost:3210, and you shall see the whiteboard. Try opening several tabs pointing to that address, draw, and see what happens.
